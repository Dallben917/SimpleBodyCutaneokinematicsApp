Therapy Tool to select stretches for burn patients
Instructions for using the Simple Cutaneokinematic Body App

The user can click on Body Cutaneokinematic regions affected by skin injuries. 
Each selected region will turn red and return information at the bottom of the screen under three labeled sections: Skin Affected, Stretches to Perform, and Potential Functional Implications. 
Clicking on a region a second time, will deselect that region and remove data output for that section at the bottom of the screen. 
At the bottom of the image, the program will display the list of cutaneokinematic selections followed by a list of prescribed stretches for full-thickness and deep partial-thickness injuries. 
The last list is possible functional implications from burns to these different skin regions. 
The Functional Implications list is not exhaustive but rather general insight by the database authors based on locations of injuries. 
The "Clear Selections" button will clear all selection of body regions and corresponding information so the clinician can start over.
